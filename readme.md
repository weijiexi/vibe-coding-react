# Emily's Trinkets - React Router

## Running this project

This project is set up with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), an npm package
that compiles our frontend assets and comes with an integrated development server.

The dev server runs on port `5173` by default, but will use another if `5173` is
being used by another application.

- Clone the repo.
- Navigate into the project folder.
- Run `npm i` to download the project's dependencies listed in the `package.json`.
- Run `npm run dev` to compile the React project and spin up the app on `http://localhost:5173`.
